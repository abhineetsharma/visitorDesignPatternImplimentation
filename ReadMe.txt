Identical Record

Used a HashMap to store the list of courses and with student ids list :
Insert and lookup into the HashMap is of O(1)
The course were added using Tree set and Insert into tree set is done with Time complexity O(lg n)

Total complexity of the implementation is O(n)

Logger added ,command line keys :
1. FileProcessor
2. Constructor
3. INFO (All operation printed)
